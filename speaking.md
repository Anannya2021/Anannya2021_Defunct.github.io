# Speaking

I really enjoy speaking at meetups and conferences for digital folk.
Talks are typically fast paced, entertaining (hopefully),
and generally a little different from the majority of sessions.

One of my current talks focuses on the HTML5 speechRecognitionAPI and how it helps
write hip-hop lyrics. I'd love to find more opportunities to deliver it at conferences
and meetups with a code of conduct in place.

[Get in touch](https://tonyedwardspz.co.uk/contact/) or check me out on
[Paper Call](https://www.papercall.io/speakers/tonyedwardspz) if you'd like me to speak at your event.
