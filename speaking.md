I have been known to speak at meetups and conferences for developers, generally
focusing on modern web technologies. Talks are typically fast paced, entertaining,
and always a little different from the majority of sessions. One of my
current talks focuses on how HTMLs speachRecognitionAPI can help write hip-hop songs.

Get in touch or check me out on Paper Call if you'd like me to join your event.
