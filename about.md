<div id="about-human">
<p>Hey. I'm Tony.</p>

<p>I currently working in Education Outreach for Software Cornwall, a network or tech businesses
spanning the county. I head up Software Cornwall's delivery of the Game Changer Project in partnership 
with Cornwall College and the Real Ideas Organisation. The project focuses upon engaging with young 
adults who are not in education, employment
or training.</p>

<p>Beyond the day job, I'm co-organiser of the Future Sync conference. Whilst studying
for my degree in Web Applications Development, I fell in love with digital communities
across the South West. This love developed into my own meetup, Kernow DAT, and later the
Future Sync conference which formed part of my degree and was hosted at Plymouth University.</p>

<h2>The Back Story</h2>

<p>I created my first website back in 2002. It was a simpler time back then. Learning
the basics of web development was as easy as viewing source and poaching the good stuff.
Table layouts….those were the days. Fast forwarding to University, I focused on learning
modern JavaScript whilst creating standards compliant, cross browser web applications.</p>

<p>There, I added to my front end experience, learning about what it takes
to make great software. Usability, software design and database development were just some of
the modules covered as part of my course. As you’d expect from a degree, I’ve been
exposed to lots of languages including PHP, Java, C#, JavaScript and .NET. As a web
developer I’ve gravitated to a web stack which includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js,
PHP, Ruby, Jekyll and WordPress.</p>

<p>During the course I did a 15 month placement with Plymouth Software, building Ruby on Rails,
iOS and Android applications. As part of my placement I was encouraged to develop my own
side projects, the first of which was to re-develop an existing project from PHP into Rails.
It was at Plymouth Software where I leaned that software development is all about
choosing the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>Before starting university I had a four year hiatus from web development whilst working
in retail. I climbed to the dizzying heights of a store manager for a national chain. I
learned a great deal about the hard work and commitment needed to run a successful
business and managing a diverse team. After an especially long summer I had a moment
of clarity and decided to throw myself what I enjoyed doing……web development.</p>

<p>I could go on for hours, but I expect you’re a busy person. If you want to know more,
[get in touch](https://tonyedwardspz.co.uk/contact/). Perhaps we could grab a coffee.</p>

<p>I’ll bring the cake.</p>
