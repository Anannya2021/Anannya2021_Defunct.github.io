TL;DR: A developer advocate is a developer’s best friend!



Typically advocates keep documentation up to date, keep contact with the community, do demos and blog about the product, pass feedback on questions, and basically help facilitate a good developer experience with the company. It's a semi-technical role with high soft skills requirements.

You can think of them as public relation persons representing some software or dev methodology (SaFE agile comes to mind). You can see a lot of them giving speeches at conferences.

Hi, I'm Michael and I'm an Developer Advocate (DA). I started out as a developer some 20y ago and I've been in a DA role at different companies for the last six years. It's a super exciting and varied job: from public speaking engagements at conferences and meetups to developing demos and tools to writing blog posts, articles, and books to creating audio-visual artefacts (podcasts, interviews, demo screen casts) to maintaining advocacy sites to giving workshops and training sessions. I spend ca. 70% on the road where I meet users, customers, and partners. And then I hang out on Slack channels, in office hours, and on StackOverflow to help users. So part of the job is to get the word about the tech out there and communicate good practices.

The other part—which sets advocacy apart from evangelism—is to close the loop: I collect feedback, document how folks are using the technology, and note suggestions and complains. This feedback I channel back to Engineering and Product Management to improve the technology and shape the roadmap. As a DA, you're not Sales (we don't sell stuff, heck I don't even know our pricing) and you're not Marketing (leads are not our KPIs). You represent the technology you're advocating to developers and ops folks and your credibility comes from the fact that you're hands-on with it on a daily basis, with the goal to make people successful with the respective technology.



Developer Advocates are no exception. They should be able to provide a high-level explanation on how a feature works under the hood, or simply provide some technical insights about the product or the platform they advocate for. Many end developers will ask about this sooner or later, so be prepared.
