> Today I Learned This

This project is inspired on [TIL](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) and your propose is store and index some small and good things that I have learned some day.
I changed the project name only to make a joke with the portuguese '[tilt](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt)' word.
